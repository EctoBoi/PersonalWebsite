Hello! I'm Justin. I specialize in Javascript, whether front-end or back-end. When designing the user experience, I often prioritize perfecting the feel and accessibility of a website, striking a balance between functionality and readability. I believe a website or tool should be intuitive enough that anyone should innately understand how to interact with the product with a minimal learning curve. 

Interestingly enough, I purposefully went to work in retail for multiple years to improve my interpersonal and communication skills. Additionally, this did wonders for my ability to work in teams, as a reliable teammate, or in a leadership role. During this time, it allowed me to be independent and take initiative. Furthermore, it refined my organizational skills and ability to work under pressure, which helped me effectively manage my time.

I am actively seeking employment opportunities where I can utilize my skills and experience while also having the chance to learn and develop professionally.
If you believe I would be a good fit for an open position within your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
